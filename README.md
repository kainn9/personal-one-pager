# Hello!
I'll admit, the static site/one-pager I built with React CRA (lol) is a bit messy and not something I'm particularly proud of. Nevertheless, it serves two key purposes: providing a public platform for my resume and side projects, and allowing me to test my React UI library (outside the Storybook preview context on [Cloudfront](https://d2qhtb7c0usx4g.cloudfront.net/?path=/story/baseloader--water-dragon)). The UI Library is also an abandoned project that I'm not too fond of, but it offered valuable learning experiences. As a way of embracing and learning from older flawed projects, and pushing back against my neurosis, I've decided to make all my side project repositories public, including this one.

# Note to self:

```zsh
# This env prevents conflicts with
# custom eslint vs CRA eslint
DISABLE_ESLINT_PLUGIN=true
```
