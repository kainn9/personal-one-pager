# What is this?

I must admit, this static site/one-pager built with React CRA is a bit messy and not something I'm particularly proud of. However, it accomplishes two key objectives: providing a portfolio platform for my side projects and enabling me to test out my experimental UI library

# Note to self/ENV Example:

```bash
# this helps prevent conflicts with
# custom eslint VS CRA
# built in eslint
DISABLE_ESLINT_PLUGIN=true
```
